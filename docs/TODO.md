# DentNow Implementation — Progress Tracker

Tracks execution of `docs/implementation_plan.md` (24 tasks) against `docs/architecture.md`.

**Legend:** `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` DONE · `[!]` blocked/needs-input

**Scope note:** This is a full rewrite of a static React SPA into a Docker Compose monorepo
(qf/Flask backend, PostgreSQL 18, MinIO, Keycloak, TS/React admin, publishing/preview
pipeline, CI, backups). It is large; progress is committed task-by-task.

## FOLLOW-UPS (2026-07-13)

- [x] Persisted drag ordering for articles, offers, clinics, clinic gallery, doctors, homepage services, partners, news, CAS content, and clinic FAQs.
- [x] Rich doctor profiles with extended biography, approach, credentials, and supporting photography in admin and `/echipa/:slug`.
- [x] Homepage contact clinic cards and gallery thumbnails use clearly separated white surfaces; removed the obsolete quick-services strip.
- [x] Backend settings load explicitly from `backend/.env` while process/container environment variables retain precedence; paired frontend/backend Docker Hub publishing is configured.
- [x] `/admin/articole` uses the full available admin workspace width.
- [x] `/noutati/:slug` public detail pages render admin-authored content, every `/noutati` card has a visible „Citește mai mult” action, and news media/detail preview are admin-configurable.
- [x] Restored grouped quiz question/answer CRUD with per-question „Adaugă răspuns”, answer editing/removal under its parent, result bands, and persisted drag ordering for whole question groups.
- [x] Built `/admin/before-after` CRUD with separate before/after uploads, clinic/treatment links, consent approval/revocation, browser-only live draft preview, and persisted drag ordering.
- [x] Rebuilt Footer from live API data: dynamic treatment services, dynamic clinics, per-clinic phone/WhatsApp/map contacts, API social/email links, and a tested allow-list of valid internal resource/legal routes.
- [ ] Connect `/confidentialitate`, `/gdpr`, and `/termeni` to legal-document CRUD and update seed data.

## CODE REVIEW & REPAIR + FOLLOW-UPS (2026-07-12, session 2)

Later follow-up requests (session 2, batch 2):
- [x] **cmdk quick actions** — command palette now has a „Creează” group (clinic, medic, tratament, ofertă, partener, articol, noutate, serviciu, imagine galerie), gated on write capability, plus section navigation + content search.
- [x] **Editor full-width + bigger preview** — removed the `maxWidth:1600` cap on all editors, widened the preview column (1.2fr) and made the preview panel a tall sticky pane; trimmed admin content padding.
- [x] **Location page booking** — `/locatii/:slug` bottom CTA now calls/WhatsApps the current clinic directly instead of opening the all-locations picker.
- [x] **Dedicated /nou editors for generic CRUD** — new reusable `ResourceEditorScreen` (full-page form + live preview) + `ResourceScreen` is now a list that navigates to it. noutati, servicii-dentnow, galerie clinică, legal, quiz all get `/nou` + `/:id` dedicated pages with preview + Precompletează, matching the bespoke editors.
- [x] **Draft preview** — preview unsaved clinic/offer/treatment/doctor and generic-resource form values without going live; same-origin `postMessage` drafts are memory-only and discarded on editor exit.
- [x] **Quiz nested authoring** — restored as grouped question/answer CRUD with question-level drag ordering after the temporary parent-only editor was requested and later superseded.
- [x] **Enterprise URL terminology** — visible “Slug” labels were replaced with “Adresă URL”/“Adresă”; API contracts keep the internal `slug` field.
- [x] **Remove unused site settings** — deleted `/admin/setari`, its navigation/cmdk entry, route, and component.
- [x] **Clinic create/edit completeness** — `/nou` collects unsaved contacts, phone/WhatsApp, hours, access directions, and FAQs before the first save; edit child tables are scoped to the selected clinic and refresh the real-page preview.
- [x] **Explicit error pages** — branded 403 access denied, 404 missing resource, and 503 backend/maintenance states are wired into public/admin routes and query failures.
- [x] **Medical-team carousel** — four or more doctors render in a fluid, continuously looping horizontal marquee that never changes the page scroll position; hover/focus pauses it and reduced-motion users receive a static horizontal list. Up to three doctors retain the grid.
- [x] **Generic doctor portrait fallback** — doctor cards, profile pages, and the `/admin/echipa-medicala` upload field use the neutral „Echipa DentNow medic stomatolog” placeholder when no portrait exists; no fictional doctor name is shown.
- [x] **Explicit doctor URL conflict** — unique-address API conflicts are no longer misclassified as concurrent edits; the doctor editor shows „Adresa URL este deja folosită” both as a toast and on the affected field.
- [x] **Dynamic clinic contact picker** — call/WhatsApp modals read active clinics and their primary contacts from the public API, so clinics added in admin appear automatically instead of being limited to the three compiled locations.
- [x] **Scrollable, focused command palette** — removed the user-rejected „Navigare” group and constrained the remaining cmdk result list to an independent keyboard/mouse/touch scroll area.
- [x] **Homepage services CRUD/design** — the master `#servicii` markup/CSS was verified and retained exactly while the cards remain API-backed and editable at `/admin/servicii-dentnow`.
- [x] **Per-doctor page** — new `/echipa/:slug` public profile (portrait, role, credentials, focus, CTAs). Homepage team cards link to it; admin doctor „view” + editor preview now target `/echipa/:slug`.
- [x] **Clinic gallery CRUD** `/admin/clinica` — new `gallery_images` table (migration 0011, seeded with the 6 placeholders), service/schema/serializer, `/v1/admin/gallery-images` endpoints, bootstrap exposure. `ProofGallery` renders from the backend (static fallback); admin screen with image upload (`ImageUploadField`), title/caption/alt/position/active.
- [x] **/decontat-cas CRUD** `/admin/decontat-cas` — new `cas_steps` + `cas_faqs` tables (migration 0012, seeded from the static data), services/schemas/serializers, CRUD endpoints, bootstrap `decontat_cas`. `DecontatCas.jsx` renders steps+faqs from the backend (static fallback). Bespoke admin screen with two tables + a live preview of the real `/decontat-cas` page.


Review of the Gemini-authored commits (`4d94d3b..HEAD`) plus new product fixes. Committed task-by-task.

- [x] **Offers 400 `features` extra_forbidden** — `OfferCreate/OfferUpdate` now accept `features` (list or comma-string, coerced); `OfferService` syncs the `offer_features` child table and round-trips it in the serializer. Verified against live DB.
- [x] **Stale failing frontend unit tests** — `resource-screen`/`clinics-screen` tests updated for dedicated screens + Router. 22/22 green, tsc clean.
- [x] **Reusable, accurate live preview** — `LivePreview` renders the real same-origin public route and overlays unsaved browser-only drafts for clinic, treatment, offer, doctor, news, homepage service, gallery, legal, and quiz parent forms; auto-refresh/manual refresh + desktop/mobile remain available.
- [x] **Clinic editor missing fields** — contacts (telefon/WhatsApp/email), orar, „cum ajungi” and FAQ are editable before first save as local rows and after save as correctly clinic-scoped child CRUD; the real location preview renders all of them.
- [x] **Doctors editor** — doctors are now API-backed: new `_query_doctors` in bootstrap, `DoctorTeam.jsx` reads `useSiteData().doctors` (with portrait via media proxy + fallback). Editor gains portrait upload (reusable `ImageUploadField`), credentials field, `Precompletează`, and a live preview of the real `/#echipa` section. Also fixed `portrait_media_id` missing from doctor schemas (would 400) and the public media proxy (dropped the obsolete publication gate so newly uploaded images serve).
- [x] **Noutăți** — `/admin/noutati` CRUD was unreachable (no nav item, though the backend endpoints + registry config existed); added the nav entry so the news list/create/edit/delete works. `Noutati.jsx` was already API-driven (`fetchNews`) — fixed its broken image URL (`/media/<id>` → media proxy) and added a `published_at` field to the admin form.
- [x] **Precompletează** prefill button on every `/nou` editor — now on clinici, oferte, tratamente, echipa-medicala, articole, parteneri (fills realistic mock data for quick editing).
- [x] **Home „Tratamente uzuale”** — section already matched master (verified via screenshot; the static `services` data is byte-identical). Added a full dedicated backend CRUD: `homepage_services` table (migration 0010, seeded with the 6 cards), service/schema/serializer, `/v1/admin/homepage-services` endpoints, bootstrap exposure, and `/admin/servicii-dentnow` admin screen. `Home.jsx` renders the section from the backend (static fallback preserves the look if empty).
- [x] **Clinic gallery CRUD** at `/admin/clinica`.
- [x] **`/decontat-cas` CRUD** at `/admin/decontat-cas` with live preview.

## CURRENT STATE (snapshot)

**Deployable now:** `./ops/init-secrets.sh && docker compose up --build -d` serves the whole
app on `:3000` — public site (seeded content, per-route API loading) + hidden `/login` →
Keycloak (`:8090`, `admin/admin` in realm `doncik`) → admin backoffice with CRUD + publish.
Backend API and the public/admin shells run in Compose. The current branch is moving
all authored content to backend-owned seed data and replacing drawer CRUD with dedicated
enterprise editors. Migrations 0001–0008 exist; the complete clean-stack rehearsal for
0008/default/loaded seeds is still pending.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Backend (Tasks 3–13) + admin search (18) | ✅ complete + tested |
| Public site (14) | 🚧 API-gated shell + per-route endpoints; **pages still read seeded `src/data`** (matches, not yet pure-API) |
| Admin shell (15) | ✅ Keycloak login, `/admin/me` gating, one AntD ConfigProvider |
| Admin CRUD (16–17) | 🚧 article editor complete; clinic/treatment/offer/doctor/partner dedicated editors pending |
| cmdk (18) | 🚧 enterprise palette + search + article/public-site actions done; entity-create actions pending |
| Contextual preview (19) | 🚧 article iframe done; clinic/treatment/offer/media full-page previews pending |
| Deploy (20) | 🚧 frontend nginx + per-route serving in Compose done; preview service + prod edge pending |
| Hardening/backup (21), tests (22), CI (23), docs (24) | ⬜ not started (agents hit session limit before starting) |

## NEW REQUIREMENTS (user, this session) — to implement
- [x] **URL per admin tab** — React Router inside /admin so each useful section deep-links (`/admin/clinici`, `/admin/echipa-medicala`, …) instead of state-based tabs.
- [~] **Dropdowns for existing refs** everywhere in /admin (existing clinic/category/treatment/page → searchable `RemoteSelect`, not free-text id). *(RemoteSelect built; treatment→category wired; remaining relations pending.)*
- [~] **More CRUD**: nested quiz question/option/band editor and image-carousel/gallery media are complete; offer→treatment selection remains; real-page live preview is wired for current preview-capable editors.
- [~] **Implement Google Review syncing**: backend scheduled task to pull reviews pending. Database model `clinics.google_place_id` added.
- [x] **Restore original frontend UI**: Fixed `/oferte`, `/articole`, and `/tratamente` bug where `useRevealAll` hid items loaded asynchronously. Restored old "Tratamente uzuale" curated card UI on the homepage.
- [x] **Noutăți (News)**: Split `/admin/articole` into Articole and Noutăți modules. Connected public `/noutati` to read live data from the database `SitePublication` API instead of hardcoded content.
- [x] **Quick Publish Action**: Added "Publică" button directly to the `/admin/articole` list to instantly switch Drafts to Published without opening the full editor.
- [~] **Enterprise/professional look** + `cmdk` quick actions. *(Shell/cmdk restyled after the simpler `testing_platform` design system; remaining screens are being migrated.)*
- [x] **cmdk feature rule** — every new admin feature is reviewed for a safe, permission-aware quick action; frequent create/navigate/search actions are added, while destructive/high-risk actions remain in their normal confirmed flow. (`Articol nou` added.)
- [x] Added persistent **Vezi site-ul public** in the admin sidebar plus the matching cmdk action.
- [x] Removed the user-rejected **Prezentare generală** and generic **Pagini & SEO** admin pages; `/admin` now opens `/admin/clinici`.
- [x] Removed manual **Recenzii** CRUD navigation; reviews will be a Google-synced clinic data source, not an authored page.
- [x] Removed website publication/version controls from `/admin`. Preview is contextual per edited entity, never a global publish action.
- [x] **Articles newsroom slice**: `/admin/articole`, `/admin/articole/nou`, and `/admin/articole/:id`; full-screen create/edit form, status workflow, existing-category dropdown, safe unsaved-change handling, desktop/mobile sandboxed iframe preview.
- [x] **Non-technical article authoring:** Tiptap visual editor with headings, bold, italic, strike, links, lists, quote, undo/redo; Markdown remains the safe backend storage format and is no longer the default UI.
- [ ] Standardize every authored entity on the same pattern: list page + `/nou` + `/:id` edit page with prefilled data, unsaved-change protection, sticky desktop/mobile live iframe, and explicit save.
- [ ] Migrate in this order: clinics → treatments → offers → doctors → partners → media/carousels → quiz. Retire generic side drawers after each dedicated editor lands.
- [ ] **Clinic editor:** name/slug/status/order, complete address/postal/GPS, Google Maps link+embed, multiple phone/WhatsApp/email/booking/social contacts, hours, transit, FAQs, page route, and full location-page preview.
- [ ] **Partner editor:** optional logo upload/media selection from MinIO, relationship/badge/link/rights metadata, and desktop/mobile card/page preview.
- [x] **Homepage quick-treatment strip:** the Implant/Albire/GBT/Obturații cards are treatment-backed fields (`homepage_featured`, label, icon, price/link); finish admin controls and public API renderer so no card text is hardcoded.
- [x] Public navbar places **Decontare CAS** immediately after Acasă; duplicate “Decontare CAS / Gratuit copii” was removed from the Tratamente dropdown and seed fixture.
- [x] Keycloak bootstrap and local realm now register the exact public homepage post-logout redirect; infrastructure regression check added for the previous “Invalid redirect uri” failure.
- [x] Remove `/recenzii` as a standalone page/route and render Google-synced reviews only inside relevant clinic/site sections.

## Environment (verified 2026-07-11)
- [x] qf wheel present `backend/dist/qf-1.0.5-py3-none-any.whl` (sha256 `1863cd0d…` matches plan)
- [x] Docker 29.6.1, Python 3.12.3, Node 23.11.1, npm 11.13.0 available
- [x] `.env` at root confirmed to be **clinic content** (phone/email/address/social), no secrets
- [x] Repo still frontend-at-root; no `frontend/`, `backend/src`, or `docker-compose.yml` yet

---

## Task 1 — Move frontend into `frontend/` (commit: `chore: organize frontend as a monorepo component`) ✅ DONE
- [x] Step 1: Baseline — git status clean, fallback secret scan (no gitleaks) clean, npm ci ok, lint exit 0, vite build to scratchpad ok (101 modules)
- [x] Step 2: `git mv` src/public/scripts + config files into `frontend/`; `.env` → `frontend/content-source.env` (verified clinic content, no secrets)
- [x] Step 3: README commands → `npm --prefix frontend …`; docker-publish.yml `context: ./frontend`; scripts use cwd-relative paths (work as-is)
- [x] Step 4: Pure move verified — build hashes identical to baseline (`index-DsOQmZvi.css`, `index-DeAmoGHe.js`); lint/smoke pass
- [x] Step 5: Committed `7cb29f1` (on branch `feat/backend-admin-platform`)

## Task 2 — Typed frontend foundation + public runtime config ✅ DONE (commits `25016c5`, `fca4673`, `78d3463`)
- [x] Step 1: `tests/runtime-config.test.ts` — 9 tests (relative base, malformed JSON, non-2xx, weird strings, strict extra-key reject, wrong-realm reject, missing admin coords) — all pass
- [x] Step 2: installed antd6.5, tanstack-query, cmdk, dompurify(self-typed, dropped deprecated @types/dompurify), keycloak-js, zod4, vitest3+coverage, msw, playwright, typescript7, @types/node; scripts typecheck/test/test:coverage/e2e added
- [x] Step 3: `src/config/runtime.ts` (Zod strict, no content defaults, trailing-slash normalize, `requireAdminConfig` gate); tsconfig strict+allowJs+checkJs:false
- [x] Step 4: `playwright.config.ts` (mock/compose); `App.tsx` split entry (preview-origin / lazy admin / public); `PublicApp.tsx`, `admin/AdminApp.tsx` + `preview/PreviewApp.tsx` placeholders; `main.tsx` loads config before mount
- [x] Step 5: typecheck ✓, 9/9 tests ✓, lint ✓, build ✓ — AdminApp/PreviewApp are separate lazy chunks; keycloak-js **library** absent from eager chunk (only config field-name strings present); smoke ✓
- [x] Step 6: committed

> ⚠️ Note: an external auto-commit tool in this environment committed Task 2 files as
> `25016c5` + `fca4673` mid-work (messages differ from the plan's suggested subject but
> content matches the verified tree). Watch for it racing future task commits.

## Task 3 — Scaffold qf backend + prove contract ✅ DONE (commit `ecb8384` + others)
- [x] Step 1: wheel vendored + `backend/dist/SHA256SUMS` (verified); `.gitignore` scoped `dist/`→`frontend/dist/` so wheel is tracked
- [x] Step 2: `requirements.txt` (DentNow-scoped: flask-restx, gunicorn/gevent/psycogreen, sqlalchemy/psycopg2/alembic, pydantic, python-jose, boto3, Pillow, bleach, markdown-it-py, prometheus; +colorama/redis/kafka-python<3 for qf import chain) + `requirements-dev.txt`; contract tests written
- [x] Step 3: `wsgi.py` FrameworkApp(enable_etl=False, no scheduler/Kafka), gevent+psycogreen patch; `config.py` shim; `src/config.py` (added WORKER_NAME/ERROR_TOPIC/REDIS_*/SECRET_KEY that qf evaluates at import)
- [x] Step 4: `src/api/health.py` (health/liveness ok, readiness 503 until probes), `src/core/correlation.py`, `src/core/errors.py` (envelope), `maps/endpoint.json` namespace `api`
- [x] Step 5: venv built, qf wheel+deps installed; **10/10 contract tests pass**; routes `/api/health`, `/api/liveness`, `/api/readiness` registered
- [x] Step 6: committed

> pip hash-locking (pip-tools `--require-hashes`) deferred to Task 23 CI; floors used now for a working install.
> `.gitignore`: `frontend/dist/`, `backend/.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, caches ignored.

## Task 4 — Postgres/MinIO/Keycloak Compose infra ✅ DONE (commits incl. `8eea169`)
- [x] Step 1: `backend/tests/compose/test_infrastructure.sh` (5 checks)
- [x] Step 2: pinned services postgres:18 / minio RELEASE.2024-12-18 / mc RELEASE.2024-11-21 / keycloak:26.1; healthchecks; named volumes `postgres-data`,`minio-data`; loopback-only ports
- [x] Step 3: `backend/Dockerfile` (py3.12 multi-stage, non-root, wheel checksum verified); `migrate`/`seed`/`api` services build it
- [x] Step 4: `ops/init-secrets.sh` (7 secrets, 0600, refuses weak/no-clobber); Compose secrets + `*_FILE`; keycloak DB provisioned by root one-shot `postgres-init` (keeps 0600; postgres init.d runs as unprivileged user)
- [x] Step 5: `minio-init` → bucket versioned+private, policy `dentnow-media-rw`, app user scoped (idempotent)
- [x] Step 6: `keycloak-config` → realm `doncik`, `dentnow-admin-spa` (PKCE), `dentnow-api` (bearer-only), audience mapper, 4 roles (idempotent; leaves existing realm intact)
- [x] Step 7: **verified** — postgres18 data-dir fix (`/var/lib/postgresql`), non-conflicting host ports (5442/8090/5110; testing_platform holds 5432/8080/5100); single `docker compose up` brings up infra+init; smoke PASSED; re-run idempotent
- [x] Step 8: committed
- [x] **User req:** full app setup starts from `docker compose up` — `api` gated on full init chain; no manual `run` steps

> Note: `.env` + `.secrets/*` were auto-committed in `4909ed1`, untracked in `a213ffc`, now gitignored.
> Per user: dev uses **simple secrets** (`admin:admin`) — not a production exposure, no rotation needed.
> Production uses strong secrets (`ENVIRONMENT=production ./ops/init-secrets.sh`, enforced at startup).

## Task 5 — DB/transaction/error/migration foundations ✅ DONE (commit `6281858`)
- [x] Step 1: tests — `test_etags.py` (pure), `test_outbox.py` + `test_migrations.py` (DB-backed, rollback-isolated via conftest); 14 pass
- [x] Step 2: `core/db.py` (cached engine, pool_pre_ping, `session_scope`, `serializable_scope` REPEATABLE READ, `reset_engine_for_tests`); `clock.py` (utcnow, uuid7), `etag.py`, `pagination.py`, `mixins.py` (WorkspaceRoot)
- [x] Step 3: migration `0001_site_audit_outbox` — 13 tables (site_state singleton, links, nav menus/items, pages/sections/seo, publications immutable, preview_sessions, audit append-only, outbox/bindings/deliveries); partial-unique live indexes, indexed FKs, JSONB-object checks, pending-outbox index
- [x] Step 4: `models_all` imports site/audit/integrations; `alembic.ini` + `migrations/env.py` (reads Config.DATABASE_URL + Base.metadata) + script.py.mako
- [x] Step 5: `core/readiness.py` probe registry; `/api/readiness` runs postgres probe (generic 200/503, no detail leak)
- [x] Step 6: **verified** — `alembic upgrade head` OK, `alembic check` → no drift (fixed singleton PK auto-sequence); 14 + 10 tests pass. Container `migrate` path verified (image builds, connects, runs Alembic, exit 0) after secret-perms fix (`503a8d0`).
- [x] Step 7: committed

## Task 6 — Keycloak JWT verification + backend authz ✅ DONE (commit `c028098`)
- [x] Step 1: `test_token_verifier.py` (10), `test_authorization.py` (7), `test_admin_auth_boundary.py` (5) — in-test RSA/JWKS, capability matrix, route-map default-deny
- [x] Step 2: `token_verifier.py` — JWKS cache by kid (single refresh on unknown), internal fetch/public issuer, +azp +sub checks; Config coords from Task 3
- [x] Step 3: `capabilities.py` (matrix), `principal.py` (clinic scopes, admin implies all), `service.py` (claims→principal + injectable `ClinicScopeProvider` + admin_principals upsert), `decorators.py`; migration 0002 `admin_principals`
- [x] Step 4: `/api/v1/admin/me` (401 no token / 403 no role / 200 with roles+caps+scopes); `__dentnow_protected__` stamp for default-deny test
- [x] Step 5: CORS/headers already handle OPTIONS + `If-Match` + correlation echo (Task 3 `correlation.py`)
- [x] Step 6: **46 backend tests pass** (alembic-at-head test made head-dynamic)
- [x] Step 7: committed

## Task 7 — Site/nav/pages + clinic CRUD ✅ DONE (commit `a651155`)
- [x] Step 1: `test_site_service.py`, `test_clinic_service.py` (DB unit), `test_site_clinic_crud.py` (HTTP integration)
- [x] Step 2: migration 0003 (clinics + contacts/hours/transit/faqs, doctors, doctor_clinics, admin_principal_clinics); DB-backed `ClinicScopeProvider` wired in wsgi
- [x] Step 3: reusable `core/crud.py` CrudService (ETag/If-Match→409, soft-delete, audit, outbox, workspace bump, clinic scoping); `audit.write_audit`, `outbox.enqueue_event`, `workspace.bump_workspace_version`; site + clinic services + serializers + Pydantic schemas
- [x] Step 4: 59 default-deny `/api/v1/admin/*` endpoints (site/links/menus/nav-items/pages/sections/seo/clinics/contacts/hours/transit/faqs/doctors/doctor-clinics/admin-principals) generated into `maps/endpoint.json`
- [x] Step 5: **65 backend tests pass** — HTTP CRUD w/ ETag, stale-409, missing-If-Match 400, cross-clinic 404, editor-403, audit+outbox; qf passes Flask Response(+ETag) through
- [x] Step 6: committed

## Task 8 — Treatments/prices/offers/tech/partners CRUD ✅ DONE (commit `2e5f7bb`)
- [x] Step 1: `test_catalog_service.py` (schema+DB-check+scope), `test_catalog_crud.py` (HTTP)
- [x] Step 2: migration 0004 (11 catalog tables) with DB checks (non-negative/ordered amounts, currency `^[A-Z]{3}$`, ends_at>starts_at)
- [x] Step 3: catalog services (global = `manager_writable=False`; prices clinic-scoped); Pydantic price-kind + offer-date rules; 40 endpoints + mapping routes (clinic-treatments/offer-clinics/offer-treatments)
- [x] Step 4: **76 backend tests pass**; DB checks reject invalid prices/date windows independent of API; fixed empty-migration trap (models_all guard) + non-serializable Pydantic ctx (500→400)
- [x] Step 5: committed

## Task 9 — Editorial/legal/review/case/ebook/quiz CRUD ✅ DONE (commit `49df757`)
- [x] Step 1: `test_rich_text.py`, `test_editorial_service.py`, `test_editorial_crud.py`
- [x] Step 2: `editorial/rich_text.py` — markdown-it (html off) + Bleach allowlist; `sanitize_html` re-run at publish; `*_html` serialized
- [x] Step 3: migration 0005 (articles, news, reviews, case_studies, ebooks, legal_documents, quizzes/questions/options/result_bands)
- [x] Step 4: editorial services (slug unique, band-overlap, clinic-scoped reviews/cases); legal-approve + case-consent require CAP_ATTESTATION_APPROVE; redacted `/audit-events` (CAP_AUDIT_READ)
- [x] Step 5: **91 backend tests pass** — sanitized body_html (no script), approval gating (editor 403), band overlap, audit publisher-only
- [x] Step 6: committed

## Task 10 — Private MinIO media + consent gates ✅ DONE (commit `a58a452`)
- [x] Step 1: `test_image_processor.py`, `test_media_service.py` (fake storage), `test_media_gc.py`, `test_minio_media.py` (real, opt-in `RUN_MINIO_TESTS=1`)
- [x] Step 2: `ports.py` (ObjectStoragePort/ImageProcessorPort); `minio_storage.py` (boto3, path-style, timeouts); `image_processor.py` (Pillow)
- [x] Step 3: migration 0006 (6 media tables) + 11 **named** media FKs (round-trips); models_all wired
- [x] Step 4: streaming upload — EXIF-strip re-encode, size/pixel/bomb limits, format allowlist, original+thumbnail/card/hero variants, SHA-256 dedup per privacy class, alt-text required, failure cleanup
- [x] Step 5: delivery rules — public immutable cache; consent-bound `case_image` checks block+attestation → `410` after revoke/expiry, `no-store`; `media_public` gated on active publication (Task 11)
- [x] Step 6: mandatory MinIO readiness probe registered; `scripts/gc_media.py` dry-run-first + `--confirm-delete`
- [x] Step 7: **verified** — 103 tests pass + real-MinIO upload/read round trip; app credential bucket-scoped
- [x] Step 8: committed

## Task 11 — Preview/publication/rollback/public APIs ✅ DONE (commit `584b7e2`)
- [x] Step 1: `test_snapshot_builder.py`, `test_publication_flow.py`, `test_public_api.py`
- [x] Step 2: `snapshot_contract.SiteSnapshotV1` (Pydantic extra=forbid); `snapshot_builder` deterministic + `canonical_json`/`content_hash`
- [x] Step 3: `publication_validator` (missing legal/media/route); `publication_service.publish` advisory-lock atomic + unchanged→changed:false; audit + outbox
- [x] Step 4: `preview_service` one-use token→HttpOnly cookie; `activate` rollback (revalidates blocks, idempotent); `restore_workspace` guardrails; migration 0007
- [x] Step 5: public API bootstrap/page-by-path/articles/sitemap (active-publication only, ETag/304); `media_public` gated on publication reference
- [x] Step 6: **115 backend tests pass** — deterministic hash, publish/rollback, one-use preview exchange, anonymous reads + 304; `public_endpoint` decorator fixes flask-restx 500→envelope
- [x] Step 7: committed

## Task 12 — Integration boundary, no patient data ✅ DONE (commit `d274115`)
- [x] Step 1–4: `events.py` (versioned envelope + catalog), `ports.py` (outbound/inbound ACL), `serializers.py`, `docs/integration-contracts.md` (+ patient-engagement hard gate)
- [x] Step 5: **5 tests pass** — event `.v1` enforcement, transactional outbox insert, dependency rule (no vendor SDK/adapter in domain code), no patient/registration endpoint
- [x] Step 6: committed

## Task 13 — Export + seed current content 🚧 REOPENED FOR COMPLETE PARITY
- [x] Step 1: parity manifest + `test_seed_parity.py`/`test_seed_idempotency.py` (opt-in RUN_SEED_TESTS)
- [x] Step 2: `export-current-content.mjs` (esbuild-defines import.meta.env from content-source.env; imports data modules) → `current-site.json` + 20 assets w/ SHA-256
- [x] Step 3: page-local + config mapping (clinics/phones/schedule/social/routes)
- [x] Step 4: idempotent `seed_current_site.py` (needs_review marks; migration_baseline publication on empty DB) + `verify_seed_parity.py`
- [x] Step 5: **verified** — seed→parity OK (all 14 counts match), double-seed no-op, 5 seed tests + 120 general pass
- [x] Step 6: committed; `content-source.env` deleted (values captured; config.js fallbacks identical)

- [x] Added canonical `backend/seed.py`; it imports the audited current-site fixture and uploads a replaceable placeholder through the real MinIO media service.
- [~] `backend/seeds/current-site.json` contains clinics, contacts, schedules, social links, navigation, services, prices, offers, doctors, partners, articles, reviews, news, ebooks, technology, cases and quiz data from the current frontend.
- [ ] **Parity gap:** import every remaining page-local value, especially complete GDPR/confidentiality/terms copy, CAS/emergency/local SEO page content, clinic transit/FAQ data, treatment-detail copy, footer/home sections and any data still declared inside JSX/config files.
- [ ] Make `seed.py` seed every parity item above into typed backend records/page sections; no placeholder legal body and no current public text left only in frontend code.
- [x] Added deterministic `backend/seed_loaded.py` that layers a large synthetic prod-like dataset (clinics, doctors, treatments, prices, offers, articles) over the default seed.
- [x] Added Make targets: `make seed default` and `make seed loaded` (loaded chooses `seed_loaded.py`).
- [ ] Run clean-volume default and loaded seed rehearsals, parity verifier, idempotency, migrations 0001–0008 and Compose smoke before marking this task complete.

## Task 14 — Refactor public site to render backend data only 🚧 FOUNDATION DONE (commit `226a917`)
- [x] Step 1: `site-data-provider.test.tsx` (MSW loading/success/error, no leaked content)
- [x] Step 2: typed `publicClient` + `publicContracts` (Zod, mirrors SiteSnapshotV1) + query keys
- [ ] Step 3: convert every route to a pure renderer consuming `SiteDataProvider`/`fetchPageByPath`
- [ ] Step 4: replace unsafe/duplicated behavior (DOMPurify, derived prices/dates/JSON-LD)
- [ ] Step 5: remove retired `src/data` + `config.js` business fallbacks after parity
- [ ] Step 6: verify all public routes anonymously (mock Playwright)
- [x] Partial: `SiteDataProvider` (explicit loading/error, no compiled fallback) built + verified; typecheck/11 tests/lint/build pass
- [~] Typed treatment/offer/expanded-clinic public contracts and client calls added; route components still need conversion before deleting `src/data`.
- [ ] Navbar/footer must render the seeded backend navigation/links, not `src/data/navigation.js`.
- [ ] Home must render services, quick treatments, clinics, doctors, technology, partners and review sections from API data.
- [ ] Convert `/tratamente`, `/oferte`, `/articole`, local clinic routes, CAS/emergency/legal and all remaining routes; request only the route payload needed.
- [ ] Step 7: Commit (final)

## Task 15 — Keycloak-authenticated admin shell ✅ DONE (commit `0e79ba2`)
- [x] Step 1: `admin-client.test.ts` (bearer/correlation/ETag, If-Match, 409/401/500 mapping)
- [x] Step 2: `auth/keycloak.ts` lazy init (PKCE S256, login-required, in-memory, refresh)
- [x] Step 3: `api/adminClient.ts` (bearer + If-Match + correlation; typed VersionConflict/Unauthorized)
- [x] Step 4: `AdminApp.tsx` one AntD ConfigProvider + App; `theme.ts`
- [x] Step 5: loads `/admin/me` → shell or AccessDenied; permission-aware `AdminLayout` nav; `OverviewPage`
- [ ] Step 6: disposable E2E identity fixture (`seed_e2e_identities.py`) — deferred to Task 22
- [x] Step 7: **15 frontend tests pass**; antd+keycloak-js in lazy admin chunk only; typecheck/lint/build clean
- [x] Step 8: committed

## Task 16 — Admin CRUD foundations + site/clinic/catalog screens 🚧 SLICE DONE (commit `e1a7ef6`)
- [x] Reusable `ResourceTable` (server paging, rowKey=id, error state); `ClinicsScreen` full CRUD (Drawer form, If-Match edits, 409→explicit conflict message); QueryClientProvider wired; jsdom antd polyfills; 16 tests pass
- [ ] Replace the old “generic drawer” target with the article-editor standard: dedicated URLs, comprehensive typed forms and real desktop/mobile contextual previews for every create/edit workflow.
- [ ] Add cmdk quick-create routes for clinic, treatment, offer, doctor and partner when each `/nou` editor becomes available.

## Task 17 — Editorial/legal/quiz/media/audit admin (`feat(admin): manage editorial legal quiz media and audit`)
- [ ] Steps 1–7 (editorial/legal/quiz/media/audit features + MediaPicker/Upload/Consent/AuditDiff)

## Task 17 — Editorial/legal/quiz/media/audit admin 🚧 PARTIAL
- [x] editorial/legal/quiz screens via generic ResourceScreen (articles, reviews, legal, quiz, pages, navigation)
- [ ] Media library (upload grid, consent controls), audit explorer, NESTED quiz editor (questions/options/bands), before/after case pairing

## Task 18 — `cmdk` rapid navigation + quick actions 🚧 UI + BACKEND DONE, POLISH CONTINUES
- [x] backend `/api/v1/admin/search` (permission-scoped, min-2-char, clinic-scoped, 4 tests) — commit `+search`
- [x] `CommandPalette.tsx` (Ctrl/Cmd+K, permission-aware groups, debounced remote search, quick actions) + mounted in AdminLayout
- [x] Enterprise visual treatment inspired by `testing_platform`; safe actions include article creation and opening the public site.
- [ ] Add quick-create entity actions only when their dedicated `/nou` routes exist; preserve permission filtering and keep destructive actions out of cmdk.

## Task 19 — Contextual live preview UX 🚧 REDEFINED BY USER
- [x] Removed `PublicationControls` from admin; administrators do not publish/activate website versions in the UI.
- [x] Article create/edit has a sandboxed, responsive iframe rendering unsaved values in a blog-detail page.
- [ ] Clinic editor iframe at the matching `/stomatologie-*` route, including address/contact/map changes.
- [ ] Treatment/offer iframe at the matching public route/card, including selected entity relations.
- [ ] Media/carousel iframe with real crop/aspect/order treatment in every affected page.

## Task 20 — Production images + one-command Compose 🚧 PARTIAL
- [x] backend image (Task 4); frontend nginx image (Dockerfile + config.json entrypoint + /api proxy); `frontend` compose service; per-route public serving. `docker compose up --build` serves whole app on :3000
- [ ] `preview` compose service (isolated origin), production `edge` (Caddy TLS) profile

## Task 21 — SEO/security/observability/recovery ⬜ NOT STARTED
- [ ] CSP/security headers, redaction, prometheus metrics, safe JSON-LD; backup/restore/verify + minio_versions

## Task 22 — Cross-stack test matrix 🚧 STARTED
- [x] tester agent drives the LIVE app via Playwright (public render, requests, /login, admin) — reports bugs
- [ ] full backend+frontend coverage floor, seeded E2E identities, Makefile `check` target

## Task 23 — GitHub CI paired pipelines ⬜ NOT STARTED
- [ ] `ci.yml` (frontend+backend checks + Compose integration), paired image publish, secret scans

## Task 24 — Ops docs + release rehearsal ⬜ NOT STARTED
- [ ] README rewrite, deployment/recovery/content runbooks, clean release rehearsal

## Task 25 — Privacy-preserving visitor analytics + admin dashboards ⬜ NEW
- [ ] Add a first-party backend telemetry endpoint for `page_view`, navigation clicks, meaningful section visibility, article reads, treatment views, offer views, and clinic/contact CTA interactions.
- [ ] Derive a secret-keyed pseudonymous visitor identifier from request/network signals; **never persist raw IP addresses, full user-agent strings, bearer/session values, or unbounded referrers**.
- [ ] Parse and store only bounded device/browser families and coarse trusted-proxy location fields (country/region; city only after legal/privacy approval). Reject client-supplied IP/location identity claims.
- [ ] Add retention/aggregation policy, bot filtering, rate limits, DNT/consent behavior, same-origin validation, CSP compatibility, and deletion/rotation for visitor identifiers.
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL tables/indexes for bounded events and daily aggregates; keep this analytics context separate from immutable admin audit and from any future patient data.
- [ ] Add permission-protected admin aggregate APIs for new/returning visitors, sessions, page/section/menu views, article reads, treatment/offer popularity, CTA conversion, referrers, device mix, and time-series trends.
- [ ] Add `/admin/analytics` enterprise dashboard inspired by `testing_platform`: 1/7/30/custom date ranges, KPI cards, accessible trend charts, top-page/article/treatment/offer tables, empty/loading/error states, and CSV export.
- [ ] Add a cmdk `Analytics` navigation entry plus useful safe quick views such as “Analytics — ultimele 7 zile” and “Cele mai citite articole”; no destructive analytics action in cmdk.
- [ ] Test event validation/privacy redaction, pseudonym rotation, aggregation correctness/time zones, permissions, bot/rate-limit handling, chart accessibility, responsive layouts, and Compose traffic flow.
- [!] Confirm lawful basis, consent/cookie requirements, approved geographic precision, analytics retention, and privacy-policy wording before enabling production collection.

---

## Blocked / needs clinic input (does not block platform build; blocks content/prod durability)
- [!] Legal operator identity, DPO, retention, GDPR/cookie wording
- [!] Which Keycloak users get which roles/clinic scopes
- [!] Verified clinic hours/prices/offers/CAS/credentials/review metadata
- [!] Lawful basis/DPIA for before/after patient imagery
- [!] Off-host backup destination, RPO/RTO
